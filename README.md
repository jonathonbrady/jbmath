jbmath is a standalone mathematics animation tool for lecturers and content creators. It's time for all students to be engaged in the classroom and foster an appreciation for the beauty of math. No more monotonous chalkboard lectures and no more complicated animation libraries.

Of course, you don't have to be presenting strictly math-related topics in order to use jbmath! The only expectation is that you are reasonably familiar with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org), an easy-to-learn document typesetting system&mdash;which, if you're a math student or professor, is essentially a second language to you.

## Installation

jbmath will have formal releases once it is in a state of even remote functionality. For the time being, however, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. You can then run `npm start` and access jbmath at `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Why not use...?

- [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) - manim is excellent! If your goal is to make videos with the extremely high level of sophistication seen on 3blue1brown's YouTube channel (assuming you are familiar with Python and all of the library's dependencies), you should use manim. jbmath's target audience is different, though, which comes at the expense of it not supporting 3D modeling or particularly sophisticated programmatical animation.
- [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office) - It isn't free, doesn't have native LaTeX support, and lacks a lot of the functionality of jbmath. If you're making a presentation on world history, then PowerPoint is probably a better choice.
