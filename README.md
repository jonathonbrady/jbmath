jbmath is a standalone mathematics animation tool for lecturers and content creators.
</p>

## Installation

jbmath will have formal releases once it is in a state of even remote functionality. For the time being, however, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. You can then run `npm start` and access jbmath at `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

It's time for all students to be engaged in the classroom and foster an appreciation for the beauty of math. No more monotonous chalkboard lectures and no more complicated animation libraries. The only expectation is that you are reasonably familiar with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org), an easy-to-learn document typesetting system&mdash;which, if you're a math student or professor, is essentially a second language to you.
